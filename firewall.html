<h1>9. Firewall</h1>
<p>A firewall prevents unathorised access from private network (safety barrier), stopping harmful activity before it reaches the connected
    devices. It does this by filtering access control point, based on certain rules (admin decides) using  IP address, domain name, protocols, programs, ports and key words.
    A firewall can be found in many places, either stand alone hardware (this is particularly used by big companies), in integrated routers,
    or they can also be found in the cloud.
