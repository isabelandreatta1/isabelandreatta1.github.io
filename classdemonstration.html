<h1>Class LAN</h1>

<p>In class, we created our own LAN (Local area network). We connected all of our computers through the switch, which then was connected to the router.
Because some of us did not have the appropriate ports to connect to the switch, some of us connected to the LAN via a WAC (Wireless Access Point).In the diagram below, you can see the IP addresses of each device in addition to the connections.
