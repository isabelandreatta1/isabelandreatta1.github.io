<h1>4. Wireless Router</h1>
<p>Wireless Router is the same as a router but it does not need a physical connection, it connects through Wi-fi signals (similar to radio signals). A router comes after a modem. While there are different types of routers, they all do the same thing: routers pass internet connection to all devices. A common example is router with multiple switch so you can connect many devices at once, and wireless access point.
