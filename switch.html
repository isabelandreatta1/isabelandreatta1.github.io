<h1>3. Switch</h1>
<p>A switch connects devices to internal network and learns physical addresses of devices (mac addresses) and can send packets to intended port.
    Because it identifies between ports, it can transmit data to the correct port instead of all devices connected to the network (i.e. refer to hub). Switches help decrease traffic and improve efficiency.
